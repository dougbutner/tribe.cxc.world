## cXc Tribe is a [holotropic](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/holotropic), defined as "returning to center", bond-based fractal organization serving creatives through biomimetic content networks. 

[cXc.world](https://cxc.world) is a tool to help creatives everywhere, currently focusing on Music. As an organization, cXc is also dedicated to personal growth + self expression by all members according to their goals and purpose. As chief, I seek to be a service-leader, guiding each member to embody the highest version of themselves, and to honor our [cXc Temple](https://peakd.com/hive-179421/@currentxchange/tribe-temple-for-cxcworld-cxc-tribe-working-document).

# The Power of Tribe 🔥
Tribe is empowered through community to act as cXc, not just as a representative, but an embodiment of the [spirit of cXc](https://peakd.com/hive-179421/@currentxchange/tribe-temple-for-cxcworld-cxc-tribe-working-document). We take the “ask forgiveness not permission” approach and trust you to express your unique value for mutual benefit, without interference, and with guidance readily available. With great power comes great responsibility, and you’ll be responsible for expressing your higher self and serving others on their journey to do so. While you’re becoming villager, take a moment, a night, a week to fully feel if this Tribe is where you belong. *We hope to walk beside you soon.*


# Walking with cXc
Tribe members may start working on anything you think will benefit artists around the world in the name of cXc without seeing approval. As a tribe member, you are cXc. We encourage you to share your genuine enthusiasm for cXc.world in public, and focus on what you like best in a way the benefits you, your music, and the musicians you want to help. You are free to work together, and can consult Tribe Leaders at moon meets for guidance finding people to walk with.

To have your cXc mini project added to cXc docs, pins, etc, bring up your project at the end of a Moon Meet. If you need additional funds, operate the project for a minimum of one month, then present a budget to Douglas or another Chief. You’ll need a full tribe vote to be given additional funds.


# How Tribe operates

You start your journey to Tribe independently by being active on cXc.world, and in our Telegram, Discord, and RTing our tweets. Once you've been around a month, you are eligible 

Check the Tribe Levels section for more info. 

# Getting Paid 
All payments are made in [PURPLE](https://github.com/currentxchange/purple-explainer/blob/master/Purple.md), the most valuable token in the [cXc.world economy](https://github.com/currentxchange/purple-explainer).  

### Base Bread
Your actions allow you to form a bond, and as long as that bond isn’t broken, you’ll get paid PURPLE every month. Every level[] above Villager gets Base Bread

### Bonus Bread (Happens at New Moon Meets)
All members, including Villagers, are encouraged to do all they can for cXc, and those contributions above-and-beyond will be rewarded. 

For now, attendees at New Moon Meets[] will be invited to share their contributions, and all Villagers+ who attend the meeting will chose their top 1, 2, or 3 contributors, with equal weight to each vote. These votes will be tallied to determine who will get Bonus Bread. See the New Moon Meets[] documentation for more information.

Current X Change is dedicated to harmonizing Humans, Collectives, and Gaia. Our media Mapps are just the start. As we refine Purple, we also seek to redefine what it means to come together as humans and co-create.
