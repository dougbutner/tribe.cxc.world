# Walk the Extra Mile, Carry More Bread 🥐

Each month, up to 3 members (or about 1/4 of attendees) who contribute incredible abundance to cXc are rewarded with a higher amount of PURPLE. Tribe will vote on who should receive extra bread. This is also the only way for Villagers to earn PURPLE before becoming a full Tribe Member. There must be some contribution for a monthly payment, and showing up to a Moon Meet counts. *We don't pay silent ghosts, but we do reward musical souls.*

> Additional rewards are up to 3x base pay

**Gathering**
- Get together with other tribe members and the wider community to discuss music, and making cXc all it can be.
- Help those looking in to come in and join the party!

**Building**
- *You dev?* Help with our [smart contracts](https://github.com/dougbutner/beta-pseudo/tree/main/real-contracts) or contact Douglas directly to see how you can be of service. 

**Speaking** 
- Constantly share the joy of cXc and our vision in public, with friends, family, strangers, and online. To be rewarded, make a measurable impact with your speech: more music on the map, more tribe members, more discoverability.

# 🌕 Moon Meets 

Moon meets are our monthly vision-sharing ceremonies on Google Meet / Zoom. This is where we collectively source our direction on this incredible journey. When we grow beyond 12 attendees, we will break into multiple moon meets, with Community Leaders regrouping after to ensure all ideas filter back to the center. We’d like some moon meets to be recorded and shared on Youtube to find fellow humans with similar vision.
