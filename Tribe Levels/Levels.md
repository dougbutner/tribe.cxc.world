If you're curious about this tribe, take the first no-commitment step by becoming a Villager. This lets you interact with tribe and naturally set yourself up to be a Tribe Member if you're having a good time. 

- Be active around the community for 1 month on at least 2 platforms: Discord (preferred) Telegram, Hive, Twitter, Reddit, and others count too. 
- Active means engage or post [on-topic](https://peakd.com/hive-179421/@currentxchange/tribe-temple-for-cxcworld-cxc-tribe-working-document) 3+ times per month (not per platform). 
- Show up at least 1 [Moon Meet](https://lu.ma/cxc), introduce yourself and talk on-topic when handed the talking stick.

If you have high ambitions, you are allowed to declare a **Tribe Member bond at your first Moon Meet** if you’ve already been active for a month.
