# Rewarding Manifestations

You deserve to be rewarded for valuable contributions to cXc. 

Each month, we'll get together to decide who has done the most, and reward them with up to 3x bonus PURPLE (256 PURPLE total for top Conjurer)

# The "Why"
cXc Tribe is about doing what you want, with a [core focus]() of cultivating creative culture. To make it collaborative, each member should have an idea of what others members are working on, and know what that Conjurer needs to further this chosen path.

For those truly passionate about helping musicians through cXc + beyond, this is an opportunity to contribute your value, and be recognized and rewarded for providing this value. 

# How it Works

Manifestation Moon Meets are open for all registered tribe. 

Each person seeking reward must publish a short post of contributions to Hive (Other text-based platforms like Medium are acceptable) a article and then comment the link (TBD where).

All who attend the Manifestation Moon Meet will be asked to vote for up to 3 Conjurers who deserve extra rewards (not ranked, just 1-3 people you think deserve more). Votes will be tallied, and runoffs will be held in-meeting if needed. 

> Do I need to show up at the Manifestation Meeting?  

Attendance isn't required to receive votes, just the post using the template. If you attend, you are allowed to vote for yourself, and get time to convince others of the value of your contribution. 

### Complete Meeting Format

> Max Meeting time: 1 hour 20 minutes

<15 min - Entry + announce mystery prize

## Mystery Raffle Rewards

Each month, a random Conjurer will win a prize of BLUX, NFTs, or physical cXc Swag. This "Mystery" prize will be announced at each meeting

Royalties from merch sales will go into a fund used to purchase physical swag. Whenever the monthly royalty revenue of the previous month exceeds 20 USD, we will have physical rewards. In the event a month doesn't reach this level, BLUX or NFTs will be the prize. 

> Royalties on Merch are usually around 20% of the sale

# Conjurers Template 

Use this [template](Conjurer%20Template.md) to organize your contributions to show off to Tribe. 

But first, familiarize yourself with how sections work.

## Conjurers Sections

### Monthly Manifestations 
These are contributions that were delivered in the month, and are the primary thing we are rewarding (see weights explanation at bottom)

Weight = 61.8% (1-ϕ)

## Still Rolling
These recurring contributions have been previously delivered and are still actively delivering measurable value in the previous month, and will continue into the future. 

Examples: Articles or videos about cXc that have measurable traffic still, recurring social media posts or automatic sharing of content from cXc. 

Weight = 23.6% (ϕ³)

### In the Bag 
Keep a one-line+link of your completed works here, and add to it each month you do something you are proud of. 

Weight = 14.6% (ϕ⁴)

### In the Works
These are contributions that you are planning but have not delivered. These aren't heavily rewarded, but we encourage you to share a bit on what you are working on, you may find help! 

Weight = 0 (ϕ-ϕ)


**Weights** suggest how voters should value one type of contribution compared to another to ensure fresh contributions are always the top-rewarded activities.
