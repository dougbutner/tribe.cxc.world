# Seasons

Reflecting natural seasons, Seasons are three-month segments that focus tribe towards a common goal. 

Each season, tribe members will declare the things that are most important to work on, with the idea that each season we make major progress by focusing together on one theme, and setting measurable goals we can celebrate completing.
