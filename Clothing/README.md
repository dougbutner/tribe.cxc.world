# About our Clothes 
Before creating cXc.world, Douglas was (and is) an active [designer](https://www.redbubble.com/people/SirDouglasFresh/shop), focusing on creating bright, psychedelic all-over print products like shirts and yoga pants.

Douglas has applied his skills and art catalogue to create a flashy line of crypto fashion for cXc, including shirts for PURPLE, BLUX and SOL


# Single-Purchase Requirement 
All members are required to purchase, receive, and post a public picture of the item on any social media. If a Villager wants to purchase an order worth more than $50, only $50 will be rebated in PURPLE per month max. 


# Claiming Rebate 
For now, talk to Douglas directly to receive your rebate in PURPLE. You are required to actually receive and open your order before you get your rebate so we know the order wasn't cancelled.
